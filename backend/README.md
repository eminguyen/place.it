# How This Works

[`modules/`](https://github.com/gits-lit/place.it/tree/master/backend/modules) contains calculation for specific features of our insight program

Currently, 
- Trees
- Pollution
- Jobs

are in progress.

To run this and access it for frontend, run

```
npm start
```

(make sure to `npm install` if it doesn't work)
