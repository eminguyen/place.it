## purpose

Sometimes the need to build new structures is unavoidable. At UC Santa Cruz, the demand for student housing has pressured the school to begin building on forests that have been preserved for decades which has led to many student protests. However, at the end of the day, the desire to build more housing won't go away even if the protests are successful. In a bustling city like Los Angeles, these pressures are even more acute and our team wanted to build a more data-driven application to determine the most optimal place to build, keeping environmental friendliness, property value, and other metrics in mind.

**place.it** utilizes multiple datasets provided by the city of Los Angeles in order to rate the impact of constructing new buildings. 

### Calculating the Rating

— Insert Image of the Rating and the Stats Here —

We calculate an overall rating based on 6 key aspects of a building — its estimated carbon emissions, land valuation / market rate, parking requirements, crime rate, impact on trees, and transit score.

#### Estimated Carbon Emissions

This was calculated through a linear regression machine learning model, as @Nir will explain in depth.

#### Land Valuation

This was calculated using the Estated API, which takes in a physical address which we received by reverse geocoding latitude and longitude points using the Google Maps API. The Estated API will return the current assessed land value and the amount of tax on that property in dollars, which is useful in determining if the benefits of building outweights the cons of removing natural resources.


#### Parking Requirements

This is determined by the specifications from the [County of LA](https://library.municode.com/ca/los_angeles_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT22PLZO_DIV6DEST_CH22.112PA). Los Angeles County mandates a certain amount of parking spots based on a building's use and size, and as such we wanted to calculate the number of parking spots required. More parking spots causes more pollution and traffic in Los Angeles, and a high mandatory parking amount generally results in a lower rating.

#### Crime Rate

When placing a building, it's good to know the safety of the area you're building in. Using the [SpotCrime](https://spotcrime.com) database, we're able to see the number of crimes committed in the last month for the building's location, allowing us to assess the location and rate it accordingly.

#### Impact on Trees

Trees are incredibly important — [Support Planting Trees!](https://teamtrees.org) — and as such it is important to note how many trees your proposed building will destroy. We hope by providing this number, the user can pledge to replant the trees or consider a more eco-friendly location. We determined this rating by using the tree dataset provided by Los Angeles county. Given a point of interest where someone would want to build over, we would identify how many trees exist within a certain length and width of that point based off our tree dataset. 

#### Transit Score

Public transportation, walking, and biking are incredibly important to any kind of building, as it aids the users of the building in accessing the location. Leveraging the [Walk Score API](https://walkscore.com), we are able to score any location to determine a transit rating for the given location.


### Displaying the Data

Of course, such beautiful data needs to be displayed in a beautiful manner. Our UI was designed with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/u1RcjhQK1W572SM5c3fONY/La-Hacks-2020?node-id=0%3A1) and developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/). We used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage application state, which determines the look of elements on the website based on the user's interactions. With simple GET requests to the complex backend, we updated our element's states and populated our website with plenty of data. To generate the map, we utilized the [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/) library and threw on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to generate 3D buildings. Finally, to tie the whole application together and really make it look beautiful, we used [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as our UI framework, [less](http://lesscss.org/) as our CSS preprocessor, and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) as our animation library.

___Our application's UI was designed collaboratively utilizing Figma.___

Our application currently sits on the web using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and our server is deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Feel free to access our website at any time and if something's not working, leave a comment on this Devpost!

## Challenges
The biggest challenge we had was acquiring the best feature variables for generating a model using [SciKit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to predict Carbon Emissions (tons of CO2) from square footage and type of building. Just using the raw data, we were getting terrible linear fits, with an R^2 value of 0. We tried predicting using different columns provided by [Los Angeles](https://data.lacity.org/A-Livable-and-Sustainable-City/Existing-Buildings-Energy-Water-Efficiency-EBEWE-P/9yda-i4ya), including energy usage and year built, but nothing was working.

However, using data visualization tools such as matplotlib and [radiant](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/), we were able to deduce that there are a few outliers skewing the data. After removing those our model was able to predict the Carbon Emissions with an R^2 value of 0.7. We use this model to score potential building placements in terms of pollution generated.
